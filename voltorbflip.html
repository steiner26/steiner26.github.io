        Voltorb Flip is a minigame found in the Game Corners of Pok&#0233mon HeartGold
        and SoulSilver that can be described as a cross between Picross and Minesweeper.
        Numbers at the right and bottom of the game board describe how many points
        and bombs are in each row and column, and the goal of the game is to flip over
        all of the 2 and 3 tiles. Each tile you flip multiplies your score by its value, 
        but if you reveal a Voltorb you'll lose all of the coins you collected that game.
        As a fan of the Pok&#0233mon series and puzzle games, I would often open up 
        my copy of the game just to play the Voltorb Flip minigame. However, I was looking
        for a way to play online and could not find anything; the only related website
        I could find was a <a href="http://www.voltorbflip.com/">solver for the game</a>.
        Because of this, I decided to set out to recreate the game for online play as a
        personal project.
      </p>

      <p>
        Undertaking this project has been a great way to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript, 
        as I've began to understand each concept as it pertained to recreating the minigame.
        From CSS animations to HTML DOM navigation and jquery event listeners, I now
        have a solid understanding of the basics of web development. The site is still
        a work in progress, as I plan to add keyboard support and the memo pad that is
        present in the original minigame. The source code for this is available on 
        <a href="https://github.com/steiner26/voltorbflip">my GitHub Page</a>. If you have any 
        problems with the website, feel free to submit an issue on GitHub. Click on the image above to play!
