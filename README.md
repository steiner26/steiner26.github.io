  Brandon's Personal Website
</h1>

Hi, and welcome to the code for my personal website. I'm flattered that you like it
enough to come look at how I made it! This site was built with
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), an amazing static site generator built on
React and Node.js. I really like Gatsby because it has great seamless integration
with various CMSs and many features and plugins available for customizaton and web
optimization.

The main goal of this website is to outline my previous work while giving a bit of a
window into who I am and what I do. It's currently not meant to be a blog or a
'things I like' collection but in the future I might include content of this nature.
I might also use it to host small widgets I make for web using Gatsby.

While I have your attention, I'll add that I am looking for an internship for the
summer of 2020. You can contact me at bstein179@gmail.com or bs645@cornell.edu if
you'd like to talk more. Also feel free to take a look around my github and see my
other projects (especially [Voltorb Flip](https://github.com/steiner26/voltorbflip)!),
though as of now I don't have too much.

For now, I'm going to use the rest of this document as planning space and personal
notes for future development of this site. If you're looking back at my commit
history and stumble upon this, please enjoy the inner workings of my development
thought process.
