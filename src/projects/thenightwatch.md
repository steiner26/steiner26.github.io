## About the Game

The Night Watch is an original game created for [CS 3152 (Introduction to Computer
Game Development)](https://gdiac.cis.cornell.edu/courses/gdiac-courses.php) at
Cornell. I was part of a group of 8 students consisting of both programmers and
designers, with myselfing acting as team lead and taking on music/sound creation
in addition to programming duties.

## Building the Game

The game was developed over the course of the Spring 2020 semester and continued
after our group was sent home from campus in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Working remotely definitely posed some challenges in team communication but we
were able to power through the second half of the semester and complete the game
to match our original idea.

## What I Learned

This project was a great way for me to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript, and later on
to reinforce my knowledge of React and modern web development. Having an concrete
idea to work on really aided my workflow and helped me focus on expand on my
programming skills without having to worry so much about design or visuals. In
addition, I was able to create something that I would enjoy playing! If you'd like
to check out the game for yourself, you can do so at [steiner26.github.io/voltorbflip].
Enjoy!
