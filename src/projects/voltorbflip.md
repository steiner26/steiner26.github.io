## Voltorb Flip

Voltorb Flip is a puzzle minigame found in the Game Corners of Pokémon HeartGold
and SoulSilver that can be described as a mix between Picross/Nonogram and Minesweeper.
The goal of the game is to find all of the 2 and 3 tiles without flipping over any
of the Voltorbs (bombs). If you succeed in doing this you move on to the next level,
but if you uncover just one bomb you lose all of your points and risk going down
one or more levels. The numbers at the right and bottom of the game board describe
how many points and bombs are in each row and column, and in order to complete the
levels you need to think about the board in both directions to uncover all of the
available points. Each point you uncover multiplies your points for the level by
that value and higher levels have greater point totals so try your best to get to
the higher levels and stay there!

As a fan of the Pokémon series growing up and an avid puzzler, I would often open up
my copy of the game just to play the Voltorb Flip minigame. I scoured the internet
thinking 'surely somebody made a version of this online' but couldn't find anything.
The only relevant websites I could find were solvers for Voltorb Flip, indicating that
people were probably more frustrated with the game than enthusiastic about it. Even the
domain [voltorbflip.com](http://www.voltorbflip.com/) was being used by a level solver.
Due to this lack of an online replica, I decided to set out and recreate the minigame
as a personal project.

Undertaking this project has been a great way to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript,
as I've began to understand each concept as it pertained to recreating the minigame.
From CSS animations to HTML DOM navigation and jquery event listeners, I now
have a solid understanding of the basics of web development. The site is still
a work in progress, as I plan to add keyboard support and the memo pad that is
present in the original minigame. The source code for this is available on
<a href="/voltorbflip">my GitHub Page</a>. If you have any
problems with the website, feel free to submit an issue on GitHub. Click on the image above to play!
