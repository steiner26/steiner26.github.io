## Finix

Finix Payments is a payments infrastructure service for SaaS businesses, ISVs and
marketplaces that decreases the complexity of bringing payments in-house. Their API
is built on top of the Visa Direct API and provides additional features such as
authentication and tokenization. As part of the team at
[Weston Baker Creative Group](https://westonbaker.com) in the Summer of 2019, I got
to work on the development of a new website for Finix. I was one of two developers
working on this project and it was both of our first time fully building a site
using React and Gatsby. It was a great learning experience for both of us and we
were able to finish the new site in time for a large press release about Finix's
platform.
